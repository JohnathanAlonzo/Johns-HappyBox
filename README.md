# About the HappyBox

The HappyBox device is an open source project inspired by the Proxmark3 and similar devices for the use of ethical penetration testing.

All the materials are easily sourced online and can be put together using simple tools and methods. (Fun fact, the first prototype of the happy box was made in just an hour.)
