# Johns-HappyBox
Johns HappyBox is a device that is used for pentesting purposes involving RFID cloning.

This repository will be used to document this open source project as well as provide instructions on how to make your own or how to operate a purchased HappyBox.

## About the HappyBox

The HappyBox device is an open source project inspired by the Proxmark3 and similar devices for the use of ethical penetration testing. The creator(s) were interested in existing methods of RFID cloning and were inspired by the Proxmark3 to create open source project to perform the same tasks as needed, but for a fraction of the cost and a fun way to pentest. All the materials are easily sourced online and can be put together using simple tools and methods. (Fun fact, the first prototype of the happy box was made in just an hour.)

## Required Knowledge

All users of the HappyBox must have a basic understanding of code and electrical knowledge. For those who are making their own HappyBox (either model) must be able to solder without damaging components and can do so safely. You are responsible for your safety when operating or making your HappyBox, so be smart.

## Types of HappyBox's

At the time of writing, there are two HappyBox devices in development. HappyBox Glee is a simpler version of HappyBox Jolly. Their abilities are listed below.

| Features        | Jolly           | Glee  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| High Frequency      | Yes | Yes |
| Low Frequency      | Yes      |   No |
| Cloning | Yes      |    Yes |
| Indicator Lights      | Yes | No |
| Data Logging      | Yes      |   Yes |
| Build Difficulty | 6/10      |    4/10 |
| Customization      | Very Capable | Somewhat Capable |
| Portable      | Somewhat      |   Very |
| Cost | High      |    Low |

Compared to Jolly, Glee is a low cost alternative with limited features but still very capable. The main difference that would most likelt be a dealbreaker for some is the fact the Glee does not have a low frequency module. This means if your try cloning a LF (low frequency) card using Glee, you will not receive an output. See the customization section for ways to upgrade your Glee to accomodate for your needs. In future versions we would like to add wireless capability to both devices. However this is only an idea and is not to be taken as a definite feature to be added.

## Tools Needed (and Recommended Materials)

For building your HappyBox (either model) you will need a soldering iron and solder. Those are the bare minimum tools to make your HappyBox.

I highly recommend that you get (or make) a pcb holder. Although it is not necessary, having a pcb holder is a great tool to have when soldering. Way too many times have I gotten frustrated while soldering because of a pcb that won't stay still. If you have a 3D printer, you can find models to print online.

I don't care if you think you are tough and can handle a bit of solder fumes. Use a fan. I'd run out of fingers counting the amount of times I've gotten headaches while inhaling fumes from solder while working. Using a fan to blow away these fumes is extremely recommonded, expecially if you will be doing long soldering sessions. I find that an old computer fan works great. Hook it up to whatever powersource that is safe for it and position it in an ideal position. There you go. No more headaches.
